            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <h4>For a long time I was engaged in website layout as my hobby. By studying most of the information on the Internet, I was able to gain new knowledge to master most of the skills in layout and help my friends with their projects on a voluntary basis.</h4>
            <h4>Quite recently, the idea occurred to me that I want to completely change the direction of my work and leave my current profession in order to become more professional in layout, as well as learn the basics of Java development.</h4>
            <h4>Also, during my self-study, I mastered Figma, and also became a confident user of Photoshop, for additional self-development. I like to code, as well as retouch photos, design my designs in my free time, but I would really like this hobby of mine to become something more in my life.</h4>
            <h4>I am sure that over time I will be able to devote more time to what I love. I will also be able to master even more information due to the ability to manage my time, search for information on the Internet, as well as the desire to master as many skills as possible. At the moment, my plan is to take an initial course in Java development, as well as improve my English language proficiency.</h4>
